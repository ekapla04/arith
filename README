       Architecture:
            40image.c - driver for program as a whole
            a2plain.c - polymorphic interface for uarray2
            bitpack.c - implementation of bitpack interface, 
                        packs info into a codeword
            block_info.h - holds block struct containing 
                           quantized information
            compress40.c - high up implementation of compression
            compression.c - compresses information of a 2x2 block into 
                            a codeword
            compression.h - interface of compression.c
            decompression.c - decompresses information of a 2x2 block
                              stored in a codeword
            decompression.h - interface of decompression.c
            imageIO.c - handles reading in a ppm
            imageIO.h - interface of imageIO.c
            Makefile - Makefile for arith, ppmdiff, and bitpack
            Pnm_CVS.h - struct holding component video color space 
                        values
            ppmdiff.c - checks the percent difference between two images
            transformCVS.c - converts CVS values to RGB values
            transformCVS.h - interface of transformCVS.c
            transformRGB.c - converts RGB values to CVS values
            transformRGB.h - interface of transformRGB.c
            uarray2.c - implementation of an unboxed 2d array

    Acknowledgements:
        We recieved help from numerous TAs figuring out a memory issue
        surrounding struct pointers versus structs themselves and freeing 
        associated memory. 

    Implementation:
        Overall, our program functions properly to compress and decompress
        a ppm image. That being said, we are unsure of the behavior of our 
        program if given an abnormal codeword or if fgetc hits eof 
        before we're done reading in values. We believe our bitpack 
        implementation takes care of it but aren't entirely confident.
        Another weakness in our program is the percent difference between
        input ppm and output ppm using our ppmdiff program. For large 
        images our program yields about a 7.5% difference. We believe this
        is due to lost precision in transformation and compression of Y 
        values, but were unable to track down a specific source of this 
        discrepancy.

        Another uncertainty we had was in declaring global variables. We put
        our global varibales in decompression.c. Decompression.c and 
        decompression.h act as "parent" files for the other files, including
        key components such as structs. There is likely a better way to ensure
        that all files have access to struct information and global variables,
        but this was the most efficient way we could think to make those 
        details available to the entire program given the files we could 
        manipulate.

    
    Assignment:
        This assignment took us approximately 10 hours to analyze and 30 
        hours to solve.
